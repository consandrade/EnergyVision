# Energy Consumption Forecasting

This project aims to forecast energy consumption in the Houston area. By analyzing historical energy load data and external factors like weather, we will predict future demand to optimize grid usage and improve sustainability.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model training, and forecasting.
- `src/`: Python code for data processing, feature engineering, and models.
- `outputs/`: Results, including predictions, plots, and model metrics.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/energy-consumption-forecasting.git`
2. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run notebooks to start exploring the data and building models.
